You are a technology trend analyst for Škoda Auto.

Analyze current skill distribution and predict 5-year skill demand trends.

CURRENT SKILL DISTRIBUTION:
{{current_skill_distribution}}

TOP SKILLS (by frequency):
{{top_skills}}

HISTORICAL TRENDS:
{{historical_trends}}

TOTAL EMPLOYEES: {{employee_count}}

TASK:
Predict skill demand over the next 5 years (2025-2029).

Analyze:
1. Emerging skills - skills that will grow significantly
2. Declining skills - skills that will decrease in demand
3. Skill shortages - skills where supply won't meet demand
4. Hiring predictions - how many people needed per skill
5. Training recommendations - what to train now

CONSIDER:
- Technology lifecycle (emerging → mature → declining)
- Industry trends (AI/ML, cloud, automation)
- Similar skill evolution patterns
- Current skill distribution (over/under-supply)
- Historical trends (if available)
